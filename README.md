linkedin-selenium-scraper 0.1.0
===============================

I created this scraper to help me pull my Linkedin profile data for a live resume.  Scrapers for
 Linkedin already existed, but I could find nothing compatible with python 3 and unfortunately
 Scrapy is not yet fully compatible with Python 3 so I decided to build this with selenium instead.

Anything available on a LinkedIn public profile should be accessible through this interface.

Installation
============

Via pip:
pip install git+git://github.com/dredivaris/linkedin_selenium_scraper.git
